But understanding from where did this area comes from

So keeping that in mind, if we want to decode how the area of circle is pie*r^2, 
what we can do is 

<h2> Try to cut down its area into different ways and rearranging and if we come up with the 
     idea of cutting it down into many concetric circles. </h2>

This seems promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle, and ** maths has a tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries **

Now, if we take some inner circle with radius r between 0-3 

** If we can find a nice expression for the area for each ring like the above and add all up, it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's area **

So ...
